## Motiviations

Good introduction to compiler frontend.
Most JavaScript source code will break the tokenizer.

Backend wasn't my main focus, it only generates markdown using a templating engine.

## Projet goal

Document functions from any language.
It should be clear (without author explainations) what the module does: its impact on arguments, used environnement variables, â€¦

## Requirements

* C++11
* Mustache templating engine: https://github.com/no1msd/mstch
* Flex
* GNU/Bison
